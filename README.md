# Used Phone Price Prediction Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the "Used Phone Price Prediction" analysis conducted in August 2023 by Aishwarya Akkim, Ganavi Hemachandra, and Saurabh Kale, as part of the Advanced Big Data Analytics/AI course (IFT 512) at Arizona State University.

## Introduction

The "Used Phone Price Prediction" analysis aims to develop a predictive model using Python, NumPy, Seaborn, and scikit-learn to accurately analyze and forecast resale prices of smartphones and tablets. The analysis provides insights into the key features and usage patterns that influence used device prices, enabling stakeholders in the smartphone industry, resale platforms, and consumers to make informed decisions.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of the analysis is to address the pricing challenge faced by a company specializing in the collection and resale of used phones and tablets. The company aims to develop a robust regression model capable of predicting the used prices of these devices accurately. By leveraging a dataset containing essential information about used phones and tablets, the analysis seeks to uncover underlying relationships and patterns within the data to guide pricing decisions effectively.

## Techniques Used

The analysis employs various techniques, including data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model selection and evaluation. Techniques such as regression modeling (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, SVM, XGBoost) and dimensionality reduction methods (PCA) are utilized to achieve high accuracy in estimating used phone prices.

## Key Findings

Insights derived from the analysis reveal valuable information about phone features and usage patterns that influence pricing in the secondary market. Key findings include prevalent phone features such as screen size, camera specifications, storage and memory, battery life, release date, and usage duration.

## Technology Description Section

- **Datasource:** The dataset used in the analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kavya2099/used-phone-price-prediction#Model-Selection-and-Evaluation).
